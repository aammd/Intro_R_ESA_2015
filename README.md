## Pre workshop instructions

### Installing R  
If you don't already have R set up with a suitable code editor, we
recommend downloading and installing [R](http://cran.cnr.berkeley.edu)
and [RStudio Desktop](http://www.rstudio.com/ide/download/) for your
platform. Once installed, open RStudio and install the following
packages. Simply paste these commands into your prompt. 

### Downloading code/data from this repository  
If you're already familiar with `Git`, then simply clone this repo. If
you're not familiar with Git, simply hit the **Download ZIP** button on
the right side of this page. If you're not sure where to save it, just
download and unzip to your Desktop.

* Please wait until Friday afternoon to this so you are able to
download the latest changes. Otherwise do another git pull or replace
your downloaded copy with a newer one.*
